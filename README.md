## random stuff

I do some little projects from time to time for fun and learning.
This repo will be a dump for them. I thought that if I make such projects public
it will force me to write less shitty code, which might make it easier to get back to
them after some time. Let's see how it works.

I doubt that code put here will have any value for anyone :P
